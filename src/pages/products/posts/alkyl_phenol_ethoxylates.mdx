At RCIPL, we take great pride in offering high-quality Alkyl Phenol Ethoxylates that meet the diverse needs of our customers. Our team of experts ensures strict quality control and adherence to industry standards throughout the manufacturing process. 

RCIPL manufactures a wide range of alkylphenol ethoxylates which are non-ionic surfactants. These ethoxylates are produced by reacting branched-chain alkylphenols with ethylene oxide, resulting in an ethoxylate chain. They are excellent oil/water soluble detergents, emulsifiers/co-emulsifiers, wetting/cleaning and dispersing agents.

### Key Features
